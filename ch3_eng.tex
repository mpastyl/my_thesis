\chapter{Hash Tables}
\section{Introduction}

Hash Tables are a fundamendal data structure that provideds fast store and lookup operations, and it is used in various programming aplications.The abillity ,for example ,to create sets and quickly perform searches on them, depends on the efficiency of the underlying Hash Table. For this reason, many algorithms and aproaches, both sequencial and concurrent have been put forward, each with its own distinctive strengths and weaknesses. 

The purpose of a Hash Table is to efficiently associate a given value with a key and use that key to rapidly store or search that value among other values.It usually consists of an array or list of buckets, which can hold one or more values , as well as a hash function that maps a value on the table.
